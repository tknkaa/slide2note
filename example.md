This image provides a concise summary and explanation of the time complexity and recurrence relations for three common algorithms: Quicksort, Quickselect, and Binary Search.  It breaks down the algorithms, explains their recurrence relations, and how those relations translate to their overall time complexity.  Here's a breakdown of the content:

**1. Algorithm Overview:**

*   **Quicksort:** O(n log n). This section describes Quicksort as an algorithm that partitions an array around a pivot element and recursively sorts the two sub-arrays on either side of the pivot. It shows a tree-like structure to represent the recursive calls, with the cost of the partitioning step marked.
*   **Quickselect:** O(n). Quickselect partitions an array around a pivot, but only recursively processes one of the resulting sub-arrays based on whether the k-th smallest element (that we are looking for) resides in the left or the right partition.  The tree diagram illustrates this single recursive call at each step.
*   **Binary Search:** O(log n). Binary search efficiently finds an element in a *sorted* array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

**2. Solving Recurrence Relations:**

The image then demonstrates how to solve the recurrence relations associated with each algorithm, leading to their respective time complexities.

*   **Solving for Quicksort (T(n) = 2T(n/2) + cn):**
    *   Expands the recurrence relation by repeatedly substituting `T(n/2)` with its definition until you reach a base case.
    *   Recognizes that at each level of the recursion, the total work is O(n).
    *   Observes that the recursion depth is log n (base 2). Therefore the overall time complexity is O(n log n).

*   **Solving for Quickselect (T(n) = T(n/2) + cn):**
    *   Unfolds the recurrence relation, recognizing that at each level, a cost `cn` is incurred, but on a smaller subproblem.
    *   Expresses the total work as a sum:  `cn + cn/2 + cn/4 + ...`.
    *   Identifies this as a geometric series that converges to 2cn.
    *   Concludes that T(n) is O(n).

*   **Solving for Binary Search (T(n) = T(n/2) + c):**
    *   The recurrence is unfolded until the subproblem size becomes a constant.
    *   Recognizes that the problem size is halved at each step.
    *   The recursion continues until the problem size is 1. Since problem size is halved at each step that yields k=log2 n.

**3. Key Concepts Illustrated:**

*   **Recurrence Relations:** The image highlights how recurrence relations are used to describe the runtime of recursive algorithms.
*   **Big O Notation:** Shows how the time complexities are represented using Big O notation, which provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm.
*   **Divide and Conquer:**  Both Quicksort and Binary search are classic examples of divide-and-conquer algorithms. They break down the problem into smaller subproblems, solve them recursively, and combine their solutions.  Quickselect uses a related principle, but only solving one subproblem.
*   **Geometric Series:** The Quickselect solution uses knowledge of geometric series to find a closed-form solution to the recurrence.

**In Summary:**

This image provides a useful visual and conceptual guide to understanding the time complexities of Quicksort, Quickselect, and Binary Search, by illustrating their recurrence relations and how they are derived.
