The image is a comparison of the time complexities of three common search and sort algorithms: Quicksort, Quickselect, and Binary Search. It also explains how to solve the recurrence relations that define their time complexities.

Here's a breakdown:

**1. Overview:**

*   **Quicksort:** O(n log n) - Sorts an array by recursively partitioning it around a pivot. Both sub-arrays are processed recursively.
*   **Quickselect:** O(n) - Selects the k-th smallest element in an array by recursively partitioning around a pivot. It only processes the sub-array containing the k-th smallest element.
*   **Binary Search:** O(log n) - Efficiently searches for a specific element in a *sorted* array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

**2. Recurrence Relations:**

The image shows the recurrence relations that describe the time complexity of each algorithm. A recurrence relation expresses the cost of a function in terms of calls to itself with smaller arguments.

*   **Quicksort:** `T(n) = 2T(n/2) + cn`.  This means the time taken to sort an array of size `n` is equal to twice the time taken to sort two sub-arrays of size `n/2` (partitioning into two subproblems) plus `cn` for the partitioning cost (partition cost is linear).

*   **Quickselect:** `T(n) = T(n/2) + cn`.  This means that the time taken to find the k-th smallest element in an array of size `n` is equal to the time taken to find the k-th smallest element in one sub-array of size `n/2` (recurse on one subproblem only, due to the pivot) plus `cn` for the partitioning cost.

*   **Binary Search:** `T(n) = T(n/2) + c`.  This shows the time taken to search for an element in a sorted array of size `n` is equal to the time taken to search for that element in a sub-array of size `n/2` (only one subproblem to search) plus `c`, a constant, which represents the comparison of the middle element and the target value.

**3. Solving the Recurrence Relations:**

The image also provides steps to solve these recurrence relations to obtain the Big O notation complexity. This usually involves repeatedly expanding the recurrence relation until a base case is reached. Each of the sections labeled "漸化式の解き方" shows these expansions.

*   For **Quicksort,** the process involves repeatedly substituting `T(n/2)` until you reach a term `T(1)`, which is a constant. After substituting, you can see the total cost summing up to O(n log n)

*   For **Quickselect,** the substitution is repeated until `T(1)`. The sum after expansion amounts to O(n) because we repeatedly divide by two, where `n` is the initial size.

*   For **Binary Search,** similarly, the expansion continues until `T(1)`. The total cost sum up to O(log n).

**In summary,** the image gives a succinct comparison of three common algorithms and illustrates how their recurrence relations are derived and solved to find their Big O complexities.
