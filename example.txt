The image presents a summary of the time complexity and recurrence relations for three common algorithms: Quicksort, Quickselect, and Binary Search. Here's a breakdown of each:

**1. Quicksort**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) - average case. In the worst case (rare), it can degrade to O(n^2).
*   **Description:** Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.  The array is partitioned into two sub-arrays around a "pivot" element. Elements less than the pivot are placed in one sub-array, and elements greater than the pivot are placed in the other.  This partitioning process is then recursively applied to the sub-arrays.  The partitioning step takes O(n) time, and with a good pivot selection, the array is divided roughly in half each time, leading to a logarithmic number of levels of recursion.
*   **Explanation in the image:**
    *   "配列をピボットを基準に 左右に分割して 両方を再帰的に処理" (Array is partitioned based on a pivot into left and right, both sides are recursively processed).
    *   **Recurrence Relation:** T(n) = 2T(n/2) + cn.
        *   T(n) is the time to sort an array of size n.
        *   2T(n/2) represents the time to sort the two sub-arrays, each of size roughly n/2.
        *   cn is the time to perform the partitioning step (linear time).
    *   The tree diagram illustrates the recursive calls. The root represents the initial array of size n. The children represent the two sub-arrays (each approximately n/2) created after partitioning.  The tree continues down, showing the further division into sub-arrays until base cases are reached. The "Partitionのコスト" (Partition cost) indicates that each level of the tree incurs a cost proportional to 'n'.

**2. Quickselect**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n) - average case.
*   **Description:** Quickselect is an algorithm to find the *k*-th smallest element in an unordered list. It's closely related to Quicksort.  Like Quicksort, it partitions the array around a pivot.  However, instead of recursively sorting both sub-arrays, it only recursively processes the sub-array that contains the *k*-th smallest element.  This makes it more efficient than sorting the entire array.
*   **Explanation in the image:**
    *   "ピボットで分割したあと、どちらか片方の部分配列しか再帰しない(kがどちらにいるかに応じて)" (After partitioning with a pivot, only one sub-array is recursively processed, depending on which side 'k' is on).
    *   **Recurrence Relation:** T(n) = T(n/2) + cn.
        *   T(n) is the time to find the *k*-th smallest element in an array of size n.
        *   T(n/2) represents the time to recursively find the *k*-th smallest element in the relevant sub-array (which is approximately half the size of the original array in the average case).
        *   cn is the time for the partitioning step.
    *   The tree diagram is simpler than Quicksort because only one branch is followed down, leading to O(n) total work.

**3. Binary Search**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(log n).
*   **Description:** Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a specific element within a *sorted* array. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half. If the middle element of the interval is the target element, the search is successful. If the target is less than the middle element, the search continues in the left half. Otherwise, it continues in the right half.
*   **Explanation in the image:**
    *   "既にソート済みの配列の中で 目的の1個だけ探す" (Search for only the target element within an already sorted array).
    *   **Recurrence Relation:** T(n) = T(n/2) + c.
        *   T(n) is the time to search an array of size n.
        *   T(n/2) represents the time to search the remaining half of the array after eliminating the other half.
        *   c is a constant representing the time to compare the target element with the middle element.
        * In other words, since we look at the middle to find the result and if it is not the correct result we cut in half and look at the middle again.  Every single step we half the size and add a constant to find the middle.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **Divide and Conquer:** All three algorithms (to varying degrees) utilize the "divide and conquer" paradigm. They break down a problem into smaller subproblems, solve the subproblems recursively, and then combine the results.
*   **Recursion:** The recurrence relations express the recursive nature of the algorithms.
*   **Sorted vs. Unsorted:** Binary search requires the input array to be sorted. Quicksort sorts the array.  Quickselect finds a specific element without fully sorting.
*   **Efficiency:** Binary search is the most efficient (logarithmic time complexity) because it eliminates half of the search space in each step.  Quickselect and Quicksort perform a linear amount of work (O(n)) at each level of the recursion, but Quicksort does this for all the elements.

In summary, the image provides a concise visual and mathematical representation of the computational complexity of these fundamental algorithms.
